# Thanks

Life is better when your mind is grateful, so give thanks, share your gratitude with others.

The goal of this app is to make recording thankfulness as frictionless as possible - write, it, speak it, photograph it, scribble it, share it.

Over time the thanks will be used to help inspire you (no idea how yet but machine learning something something something).

Oh, and it should look beautiful - always.
